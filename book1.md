## Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ [2nd.Edition]

### Chapter 2

#### Book examples



``` cpp
// * The program prints a message on the screen. * //

#include "stdafx.h"
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello, World!\n";

    return 0;
}
```

#### Review

```
1. What is the purpose of the “Hello, World!” program?

The purpose to writing this program is to test the programming environment and to give us a first feel of how we
can get a computer to do things for us.

2. Name the four parts of a function.



3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.
4. In the “Hello, World!” program, what is the purpose of the line return 0;?
5. What is the purpose of the compiler?
6. What is the purpose of the #include directive?
7. What does a .h suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?
8. What does the linker do for your program?
9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?
10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?
11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?
```

#### Terms

```
// - anything written after the token // on a line is a comment. Comments are ignored by the compiler and written
for the benefit of programmers who read the code. Comments are written to describe what the program is intended 
to do and in general to provide information useful for humans that can’t be directly expressed in code.
